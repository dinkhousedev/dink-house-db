## ⚠️ Remaining Manual Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Migrations

The migrations need to be applied manually due to existing schema conflicts.

**Go to:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/wchxzbuuwssrnaxshseu/sql/new

**Apply in this order:**

1. Copy and run: `supabase/migrations/20251002150000_add_newsletter_opt_in_out.sql`
2. Copy and run: `supabase/migrations/20251002150100_newsletter_opt_in_functions.sql`
3. Copy and run: `supabase/migrations/20251002150200_confirmation_email_template.sql`

**How to apply:**
```bash
# Option 1: Via Supabase SQL Editor (Recommended)
1. Open the SQL Editor in Supabase Dashboard
2. Copy contents of migration file
3. Paste and execute
4. Verify "Success. No rows returned."

# Option 2: Via command line
cat supabase/migrations/20251002150000_add_newsletter_opt_in_out.sql | \
  supabase db execute --linked
```

### Step 2: Verify Edge Function Deployment ✅

**Status:** Already deployed!

```bash
✅ generate-marketing-email function deployed successfully
```

Verify at: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/wchxzbuuwssrnaxshseu/functions

### Step 3: Set Up Confirmation Email Sending

You need to integrate confirmation email sending into your newsletter signup flow.

**Option A: Database Trigger** (Recommended)

Create a trigger that calls your email service when a subscriber is created:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION send_confirmation_email()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
DECLARE
  v_confirmation_url TEXT;
BEGIN
  IF NEW.status = 'pending' AND NEW.verification_token IS NOT NULL THEN
    v_confirmation_url := 'https://dinkhousepb.com/confirm-subscription?token=' || NEW.verification_token;

    -- Call your email sending function or service
    -- This depends on your email infrastructure
    PERFORM send_email(
      NEW.email,
      'newsletter-confirmation',
      jsonb_build_object(
        'first_name', NEW.first_name,
        'confirmation_url', v_confirmation_url,
        'email', NEW.email
      )
    );
  END IF;

  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE TRIGGER trigger_send_confirmation_email
  AFTER INSERT ON launch.launch_subscribers
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION send_confirmation_email();
```

**Option B: Application Layer**

Send email immediately after signup in your API:

```typescript
// After successful signup
if (result.success && result.verification_token) {
  const confirmationUrl = `https://dinkhousepb.com/confirm-subscription?token=${result.verification_token}`;

  await sendEmail({
    to: email,
    template: 'newsletter-confirmation',
    subject: 'Confirm Your Subscription to The Dink House',
    variables: {
      first_name: firstName,
      confirmation_url: confirmationUrl,
      email: email
    }
  });
}
```

### Step 4: Deploy Frontend Changes

```bash
cd dink-house-landing-dev

# Build production bundle
npm run build

# Deploy to your hosting provider
# (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
```

### Step 5: Test End-to-End

**Test Signup Flow:**
1. Go to https://dinkhousepb.com
2. Submit newsletter form with test email
3. See "Check your email" message
4. Check inbox for confirmation email
5. Click confirmation link
6. See success page
7. Verify subscription is active in database

**Test Unsubscribe Flow:**
1. Send a marketing email to test subscriber
2. Click unsubscribe link in email footer
3. See unsubscribe confirmation page
4. Verify subscription marked inactive
5. Confirm no more emails are sent

**SQL to verify:**
```sql
-- Check subscriber status
SELECT email, status, is_active, verified_at, unsubscribed_at
FROM launch.launch_subscribers
WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

-- Check confirmation worked
SELECT * FROM system.activity_logs
WHERE action = 'newsletter_subscription_confirmed'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check unsubscribe worked
SELECT * FROM system.activity_logs
WHERE action = 'newsletter_unsubscribed'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

## 📊 Feature Overview

### Double Opt-In Flow
1. User enters email → Status: `pending`, Active: `false`
2. User receives confirmation email with verification token
3. User clicks confirmation link → Status: `active`, Active: `true`
4. User starts receiving newsletters

### Unsubscribe Flow
1. User clicks unsubscribe in email (contains secure token)
2. Page auto-processes unsubscribe
3. Status: `inactive`, Active: `false`, Unsubscribed_at: `NOW()`
4. User immediately stops receiving emails

### Security Features
- ✅ 64-character hex tokens (cryptographically secure)
- ✅ Unique tokens per subscriber
- ✅ One-time use verification tokens
- ✅ Persistent unsubscribe tokens (permanent links)
- ✅ SQL injection prevention
- ✅ Input validation

### Compliance
- ✅ GDPR: Double opt-in, easy unsubscribe, consent tracking
- ✅ CAN-SPAM: Unsubscribe in every email, immediate removal
- ✅ CASL: Express consent, clear sender ID, prominent unsubscribe

## 📝 Quick Reference

### API Endpoints

```bash
# Newsletter Signup (now requires confirmation)
POST /rest/v1/rpc/submit_newsletter_signup
{
  "p_email": "user@example.com",
  "p_first_name": "John",
  "p_last_name": "Doe"
}

# Confirm Subscription
POST /rest/v1/rpc/confirm_newsletter_subscription
{
  "p_verification_token": "abc123..."
}

# Unsubscribe
POST /rest/v1/rpc/unsubscribe_newsletter
{
  "p_unsubscribe_token": "xyz789...",
  "p_reason": "Optional feedback"
}
```

### Frontend Routes

```
/confirm-subscription?token=VERIFICATION_TOKEN
/unsubscribe?token=UNSUBSCRIBE_TOKEN
/unsubscribe?email=EMAIL  (fallback)
```

### Database Queries

```sql
-- Get all active subscribers
SELECT * FROM launch.launch_subscribers
WHERE status = 'active'
  AND is_active = true
  AND verified_at IS NOT NULL;

-- Get pending confirmations
SELECT email, subscription_date
FROM launch.launch_subscribers
WHERE status = 'pending'
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';

-- Unsubscribe analytics
SELECT
  DATE(unsubscribed_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as unsubscribes,
  STRING_AGG(DISTINCT unsubscribe_reason, ', ') as reasons
FROM launch.launch_subscribers
WHERE status = 'inactive'
GROUP BY DATE(unsubscribed_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Monitor these KPIs:

- **Opt-in Rate:** Confirmations / Signups (target: >60%)
- **Unsubscribe Rate:** Unsubscribes / Active (target: <2%)
- **Bounce Rate:** Bounces / Sent (target: <1%)
- **Engagement Rate:** (Opens + Clicks) / Sent (target: >30%)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Subscriber not receiving confirmation email
- Check email sending function/trigger is working
- Verify SENDGRID_API_KEY is set correctly
- Check spam folder
- Review SendGrid activity logs

### Confirmation link not working
- Verify token hasn't been used (cleared after confirmation)
- Check subscriber has `status='pending'`
- Ensure token matches database exactly (case-sensitive)

### Unsubscribe not working
- Verify unsubscribe token exists and is valid
- Check API permissions for unsubscribe function
- Review system.activity_logs for errors
